@aking1012 Unity like a fungus... interesting. I hated it in 10.10. Netbook + unity = angry me because I couldn't hide the launcher back then.
then 11.04 came along and i was OMG ITS ALPHA BUT ITS SOOOO AWESOME.

Menu system was hard coded in my habits, and a right-click application menu on the desktop was also something I was used to. Yes I admit I'm change averse
@jrg I think we covered this in one of my questions here on AU?

Q: Does anyone have any idea if/when Ubuntu is going to switch the default ruby install from 1.8 train to the 1.9 train?

aking1012I'm kind of hoping it's not going to be a python 2.7/3.0 thing, but I thought I might find someone "in the know".
default ruby
 
jrg
jrg
@aking1012 we did, its because ruby was at 1.9.1 for so long that everyone used it, and it didn't get swapped because of library compatibility.
 
aking1012
aking1012
Yep
 
jrg
jrg
Which brings us back to the following: If you're doing ruby stuff, really, debian based distros suck for package managed ruby. Go use Fedora/a rpm distro, since they don't try to circumvent gem with yum like debian tries to with apt.

or you could just not use the packaged ruby like most people do instead of switching OSes
sure you can. :)

yeah, I was walking by to the bathroom
and I saw the background from like a mile away
@MarcoCeppi is there no way to pull all the charms at once with normal bzr?
bzr branch lp:charms doesn't work
now that I use sublime I was thinking of pulling all of the charms and doing all the READMEs at once
 
Marco Ceppi
Marco Ceppi
You can use charm get all
 
Jorge Castro
Jorge Castro
then how would I push back?

@JorgeCastro Each charm maintains it's own .bzr directory, IIRC
So you'll need to commit each and push, but you could script that pretty quickly with bash
 
Jorge Castro
Jorge Castro
@MarcoCeppi try sublime
it's so awesome
you can just open a directory
 
Marco Ceppi
Marco Ceppi
Never heard of it

webup8te has a ppa.
I might buy it, it's that awesome.
If it was in USC I would have bought it after 10 minutes of playing with it.
 
jrg
jrg
Yeah, same here. One of these days I'll buy it. But right now, the free trial version that nags you is sufficient.
 
Jorge Castro
Jorge Castro
mine hasn't nagged me
I found an octopress plugin for it
but it's not that awesome
 
jrg

it nags you every like, 10 or 20 saves iirc.
there is a twitter plugin, but i haven't been able to get it to work on ubuntu
 
Jorge Castro
Jorge Castro
I sent them a mail asking them to submit it
it's for pay, they wouldn't even have to package it, they would just have canonical do it
it's win/win imo!

Q: What is the keyboard shortcut to minimise a window to launcher in unity 12.04?

EwanIn 10.10 that I was using before 12.04 you could use alt+F9 to minimise a window to the task bar. In 12.04 meta+ctrl+ cursor up down maximises and unmaximises a window. If you have a numeric keypad you can use ctrl+alt+0 to minimise to launcher. On my netbook I don't have a numeric keypad and the...
unity shortcut-keys 12.04
it's this just ctrl-alt-d?
 
jrg
jrg
@JorgeCastro it does that for everything.
Sweet, time to implode my 12.04 install so I can properly test the 11.10 > 12.04 Wubi setup
I've never been happy to delete Ubuntu. This is a weird feeling. :p
 
Jorge Castro
Jorge Castro
oh, an individual window?

@JorgeCastro some of the comments were for the older answer, which i have since revised. i have updated the answer as well.
@jorgecastro it effectively is the same answer as that of Bruno, but without instructions on how to reset it.

@lazyPower You seem to be interested in the charm stuff. Are you doing it on a single user computer or does it have to be a eucalyptus/UEC instance?
 
lazyPower

i'm using AWS to debug this charm
i think i borked something in my metadata - its not giving me debug output on deployment. so i have no idea if its actually doing what it should be doing. my juju-log statements aren't hitting the debug logs at any rate.
 
aking1012
aking1012

:( hope you get it sorted. I'm doing a bit of light reading on juju and local private clouds with eucalyptus, so I can practice for free.
 
lazyPower
lazyPower
aws comes with a free year of t1 micro service -- if you want to get your feet wet with amazon.
Ah, just looked up Eucalyptus - thats cool.
bridging the cloud and your personal network
 
aking1012
aking1012
Yeah, it would be epic for educational institutions. A cheap way to teach on cloud. It's my understanding it's part of what UEC is built from as well, so the transition would be easy-ish.
